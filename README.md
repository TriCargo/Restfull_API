Getting Started with Spring Boot
This project was bootstrapped with Spring Boot.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

mvn spring-boot:run
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in your browser.

The application will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any errors in the console.

mvn test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

mvn clean install
Builds the app and installs it into your local repository.
This command compiles, tests, and packages the app, making it ready for deployment.

The app is now ready to be deployed to production.

mvn package
Builds the app for production to the target folder.
It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

mvn spring-boot:build
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you build, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can build at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except build will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use build. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
